This repository contains a Rust program that showcases a potential issue with using raw pointers to modify vectors.  The `bug.rs` file demonstrates the problem and `bugSolution.rs` shows a safer way to handle vector modifications. Raw pointers can lead to undefined behavior if not handled carefully, especially when dealing with memory that may be reallocated by the vector.  Always prefer safe methods provided by the Rust standard library when modifying vectors.
